						<!--  As well, upgrading it’s load capacity, as increases to electrical overhead necessitate it. -->

						<p>
							Your panel is essentially the heart of your space, pumping electricity to everything. This is why it’s crucial to make sure that your panel receives inspections, maintenance and repairs or replacement. As well, sometimes panels will also need to be upgraded as the electrical load is increased. These increases usually come from adding additional appliances and power dependencies to your home or business. Sky Electric is here to make sure your panel is safe, up-do-date, and in top working condition.

							<!-- (should I fully spell out "Photovoltaic" in case people don't know what "PV" is... would they know what "Photovoltaic" is? At least you can google the long answer? They can probably just extrapolate the meaning from the body text) -->
							<h2 class="service-title">Solar PV</h2>
						</header>

						<p>
							Installing Solar Photovoltaic panels is a sure way to save money and shift some burden to a green energy source! Energy costs are increasing, and with that it becomes prudent to adapt ways to reduce your bills. Solar PV allows you to share the power load with the energy produced from the panels. Thereby reducing the amount of paid energy consumed.
